# Autonomy Ecosystem Notes

## __Autonomy Ecosystem Talks__ - Frank Chen, Partner at a16z [[source]](https://a16z.com/2018/02/03/autonomy-ecosystem-frank-chen-summit/)

### __1. Where and How It Begins__
- Tech often gets adopted much faster than expected
    - Cell phones as an example -- expected 900K by 2000 in 1980, actually 109M
    - Same will happen for Electric, Autonomous Fleets
- Electric
    - In early 1900s many cars were electric
    - Now electric cars are <1% of sales and total fleet in US
    - But economics are reversing...
        - Most expensive part (battery) is getting much cheaper
        - Electric is getting much cheaper and more reliable (less moving parts) so maufacturers are more interested
        - More companies are interested in getting into this business, since it is way easier than ICE (e.g. Dyson)
        - Govts are incentivizing EVs, fining/banning Emission, etc
        - Bloomberg Projects EV sales take over ICE-car sales by 2038 [[source]](https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/)
        - Why: higher utlilization rates, higher vehicle lifetimes, etc
- Autonomous
    - Race between SV, Chinese startups, and Incumbents (OEMs/Supply chain)
    - Level 2 or so isn't hard, cheaply (relatively) available
- Fleets
    - Efficiency - only 5% utilization
    - Today, twice as expensive (~ $1.50/mile) to Uber/Lyft everywhere than own a car (~ $0.80/mile)
    - By 2030, numbers flip... estimated ~$0.80/mi for owned, ~$0.50/mi for shared [[source]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/59f279b3652deaab9520fba6/1509063126843/RethinkX+Report_102517.pdf)
- Car Ownership
    - young people much more receptive to shared (they want it)
    - old/disabled will need it (can't drive) -- reenfranchise them

### __2. Public Infrastructure__
- Fees that fund public infra (drivers license fees, gas tax, parking, etc) will vanish due to SDV-EV fleets... old model of funcing public infra does not work anymore
    - Infra tax in rideshare applications (e.g. Uber)?
- Efficiency
    - Can get more cars per lane
    - More people in cars
    - Automatically implementing optimal traffic patterns
    - Surge pricing to distribute demand
    - Efficiency in buses
- Reusing parking spaces
    - LA is about 14% parking lots 
    - Can reutilize and rejuvenate spaces

### __3. The Automotive Value Chain__
- Car value chain --> airplane value chain
    - Loyalty to Carrier (Delta -> Uber)
    - Consumer makes no decisions on Type of Aircraft (Boeing -> GM)
- Many features won't matter anymore, since you're not selling the car directly to consumer
- Form factors change -- new forms of cars to optimize for EV-SDV Fleet aspects
- "Carness" of car = less of a buying criteria, "smartphoneness" of car is more important
    - Can have a lot of different features/arrangements inside car -- e.g. conference tables, touchscreens, ...
-  More electronics and software in car (as % of total car cost)
- Battle to own the heart of the software going into car
    - Proprietary vs Open Source (Windows v Android)
    - Full-stack vs Modular (who owns/integrates all the components)
    - Incumbents vs Startups

### __4. Energy__
- Transportation is almost 1/3 of the total energy used in US [source needed], over half of that is made up by petroleum
- Total petroleum consumption has been linearly increasing over time (since 80's)
    - will it continue this way?
    - OPEC, Exxon project continued growth in oil demand
    - Bloomberg projects peak oil demand in 2023, all downhill from there due to increases in efficiency and electric vehicles [[source]](https://about.bnef.com/blog/this-is-what-the-demise-of-oil-looks-like/)
- But Oil Companies will hedge their bets...
    - Shell bought Electric Charging Network [[source]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-newmotion-m-a-shell/shell-buys-newmotion-charging-network-in-first-electric-vehicle-deal-idUSKBN1CH1QV)
    - Manufacturers are also investing in charging networks
- How much more electricity do we need?
    - In US, 40% more capacity needed... [source needed]
- Where will the chargers go?
    - Strategically placed public charging stations, needs to be convenient to fleet operators instead of consumers
    - Competing charging standars -- standards war?
- Car dealerships to be used as real estate for fleet servicing/storage/etc?
- Building factories and raw materials for production
    - Cobalt as scarcest raw material for Lithium-Ion batteries... highly concentrated in Africa & other politically unstable/child labor using countries... ethical sourcing
    - other battery chemistries...?

### __5. Finance__
- Auto Insurance
    - Premiums going up
    - Safety
        - Fatalities per mile driven are falling (steadily)
        - SDVs will be safer bc of better programming, faster corrections to entire fleet, etc 
        - Morgan-Stanley projects L5 SDVs will reduce accidents by 95% [[source]](http://media-publications.bcg.com/Motor_Insurance_2.0_vF.pdf)
    - Premiums shift from Consumers to Fleets [source same as above]
        -  Fleet operators could just in-house it just like many employers in-house health insurance -- take auto insurer out of the equation and make it cheaper for fleet operators
- Auto Loans
    -  Leasing operators, Fleet operators, etc buying their own cars, but consumers not taking out loans directly
- Used Car sales dynamics change
- Market Size: $739B [source needed]
- Recycle or Reuse parts
- Car Rentals -- the traditional rental market likely goes away
- Second-order effects
    - Advertising for cars & insurance falls to 0 since consumers are not buying cars or insurance...  10% of all ads spent in US is for cars/insurance [source needed]

### __6. Justice System__
- DUI's vanish
- Organs problem 
    - large portion of organs are donated from victims of car accidents (20%)... need new source of organs once accident rates drop
- Court Trials -- job loss
    - 1/3 of all civil trials deal with motor vehicle accidents... employees in this field will need to find new jobs [source needed]
- Cars as Eyewitnesses
    - Sensors everywhere means cars will be ubiquitous eyewitnesses
    - What to do with this data? new jobs created around this new data collection/processing/analyzing
- DMVs and Driver's Licenses gone -- need for new identification system?
- Big question is that of LIABILITY...

### __7. Shopping__
- Reduction of Cost of Production
    - Automation in harvesting, delivery, (trucks are SDV/remote)... etc
- Entire supply chain, from production to last-mile delivery is automated using robots, so cost of the whole supply chain decreases
    - Who owns logistics? (Fedex, or new upstart that is digitally native)
- Malls and Gas Stations go away --> need to find better uses for them
- Stores come to you? Self-driving food delivery trucks or even whole shop trucks (convenience store on self-driving truck)?

### __8. But When?__
- Let's not over-romanticize driving... reality vs picturesque
- Safer, greener, more convenient for far less of the price
- When?
    - Prediction -- Majority of miles driven will be autonomous by 2026, and 95% of all miles driven in US will be by Electric, Self-Driving Fleets by 2030 [[source]](https://www.rethinkx.com/press-release/2017/5/3/new-report-due-to-major-transportation-disruption-95-of-us-car-miles-will-be-traveled-in-self-driving-electric-shared-vehicles-by-2030)
    - Even big names in auto industry think it is close
- Tech dissemination can be faster than slower...
