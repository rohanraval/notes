# Autonomy Ecosystem Notes

## __Autonomy Ecosystem Talks__ - Frank Chen, Partner at a16z [[source]](https://a16z.com/2018/02/03/autonomy-ecosystem-frank-chen-summit/)

### __1. Where and How It Begins__
- Tech often gets adopted much faster than expected
    - Cell phones as an example -- expected 900K by 2000 in 1980, actually 109M
    - Same will happen for Electric, Autonomous Fleets
- Electric
    - In early 1900s many cars were electric
    - Now electric cars are <1% of sales and total fleet in US
    - But economics are reversing...
        - Most expensive part (battery) is getting much cheaper
        - Electric is getting much cheaper and more reliable (less moving parts) so maufacturers are more interested
        - More companies are interested in getting into this business, since it is way easier than ICE (e.g. Dyson)
        - Govts are incentivizing EVs, fining/banning Emission, etc
        - Bloomberg Projects EV sales take over ICE-car sales by 2038 [[source]](https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/)
        - Why: higher utlilization rates, higher vehicle lifetimes, etc
- Autonomous
    - Race between SV, Chinese startups, and Incumbents (OEMs/Supply chain)
    - Level 2 or so isn't hard, cheaply (relatively) available
- Fleets
    - Efficiency - only 5% utilization
    - Today, twice as expensive (~$1.50/mile) to Uber/Lyft everywhere than own a car (~$0.80/mile)
    - By 2030, numbers flip... estimated ~$0.80/mi for owned, ~$0.50/mi for shared [[source]](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/59f279b3652deaab9520fba6/1509063126843/RethinkX+Report_102517.pdf)
- Car Ownership
    - young people much more receptive to shared (they want it)
    - old/disabled will need it (can't drive) -- reenfranchise them

### __2. Public Infrastructure__
- Fees that fund public infra (drivers license fees, gas tax, parking, etc) will vanish due to SDV-EV fleets... old model of funcing public infra does not work anymore
    - Infra tax in rideshare applications (e.g. Uber)?
- Efficiency
    - Can get more cars per lane
    - More people in cars
    - Automatically implementing optimal traffic patterns
    - Surge pricing to distribute demand
    - Efficiency in buses
- Reusing parking spaces
    - LA is about 14% parking lots 
    - Can reutilize and rejuvenate spaces

### __3. The Automotive Value Chain__
- Car value chain --> airplane value chain
    - Loyalty to Carrier (Delta -> Uber)
    - Consumer makes no decisions on Type of Aircraft (Boeing -> GM)
- Many features won't matter anymore, since you're not selling the car directly to consumer
- Form factors change -- new forms of cars to optimize for EV-SDV Fleet aspects
- "Carness" of car = less of a buying criteria, "smartphoneness" of car is more important
    - Can have a lot of different features/arrangements inside car -- e.g. conference tables, touchscreens, ...
-  More electronics and software in car (as % of total car cost)
- Battle to own the heart of the software going into car
    - Proprietary vs Open Source (Windows v Android)
    - Full-stack vs Modular (who owns/integrates all the components)
    - Incumbents vs Startups

### __4. Finance__
- Auto Insurance
    - Premiums going up
    - Safety
        - Fatalities per mile driven are falling (steadily)
        - SDVs will be safer bc of better programming, faster corrections to entire fleet, etc -- Morgan-Stanley projects L5 SDVs will reduce accidents by 95% [[source]](http://media-publications.bcg.com/Motor_Insurance_2.0_vF.pdf)
